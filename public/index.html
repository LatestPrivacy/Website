							Our Story
						</h1>
						<p>
							In 2013 Edward Snowden leaked information concerning privacy in the world around us, 
							this uncovered many mysteries. 3 years later in 2016 the British government pushed their
							first draft of the Investigatory powers act 2016, this has now become the worlds most 
							prolific surveillance legislation in democratic history.
						</p>
						<p>
							The British government tried to sneak this into law with out people knowing. While this 
							was happening there were websites stating that they was petitioning against it, however 
							upon signup they sold your data, and the 3 million plus votes were silenced and 
							disregarded.
						</p>
						<p>
							Imagine if the 3 million plus people were pointed in the right direction and their 
							voice was heard. It could have had a totally different outcome.
						</p>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/173199">petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/173199</a>
						<p>
							We had enough of the misinformation, misconduct and misdirection. We want to try 
							and solve theses issues. <strong>But we need your help.</strong>
